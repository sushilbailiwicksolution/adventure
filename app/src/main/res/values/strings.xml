    <string name="product_description">A buyer persona is an imaginary customer. It is the person for
        whom you’ve developed your product and to whom you’d love to sell it (of course!). He or she
        represents your target audience, but is much more real than a vague description of some demographics.
        You need to know your buyer persona so well that you know exactly what makes her laugh, what
        makes her shake her head in disbelief, what makes her click buy, and what makes her hesitate to order.
        To describe your buyer persona, think about what she’s reading and which websites she visits,
        because that will help you understand the right tone of voice that will engage her. Consider
        what keeps her awake at night, what she dreams of achieving, and how she makes decisions,
        because that will enable you to create copy that speaks to her and taps into her feelings.</string>
